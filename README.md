+ You need to upload multiple spec files in the app with version suffixed at the end like V1, V2 etc.

+ The headers need to be exactly like the picture above.
  + If you want to multiply across all the time period, you just need to specify the variable, the factor and also the letter M for multiplication.
  + If you want to constrain the contribution in a particular year for a variable, you need to specify the variable, the contribution in % and the year you want to constrain in as show in Row 6
  + Lets say that if there is a existing variable you want to remove from a model or add in a model if it already existed, You can specify the variable in Col E and put Yes/No in Col F.

+ You can follow the same thing for different sheet for different spec in the same factor file.

+ It is a good practice to name the factor file spec names according to model name for convenience.
+ You can select the respective sheet in the dropdown in the app as shown below.
